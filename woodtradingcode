--This is where I construct the functions.
--The first one is to get wood planks, but you will have to fork up some cobblestone to do so.
--To make the function run, you will need 1 cobblestone in the chest, and I will provide the planks in slot 1.

--This one allows you to purchase regular wood blocks, provided that you can afford to give some stone.
--You can put 1 stone in the chest, and I will give the wood in slot 2.

--Again, you will have to put something in the chest. This time, it's a crafting table.
--I'll put some stairs in slot 3.

--Last, you need to provide a pumpkin to the chest.
--I'll give you some oak fence in slot #4.
